      <description>Elected Official Office Visits 2017
VISITING YOUR ELECTED OFFICIAL’S OFFICE
Visiting Your Elected Official
The ultimate goal of organizing around the issues you care about is to persuade elected officials to support your position on those issues. We use a variety of tactics to achieve this goal—one of the most effective being an in-person visit to an elected official’s office. Meeting face-to-face with an elected official or his/her staff is your opportunity to share your story with the people who represent you in making policy decisions.</description>
